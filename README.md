# Closure-Tools
An easy way to see closures and edit upvalues. Perfect way of debugging. This script was inspired by MikeSpy. Get started by running:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LuaMadness/Closure-Tools/main/ClosureTools.lua'))()
```
#### Following scripts were tested using krampus only, if you find any instability on other executor, feel free to make an issue or pull request.

Currently reworking this script to use custom UI and have more features.
