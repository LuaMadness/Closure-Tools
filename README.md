# Closure-Tools
An easy way to see closures and edit upvalues. Perfect way of debugging. This script was inspired by MikeSpy. Get started by running:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LuaMadness/Closure-Tools/main/ClosureTools.lua'))()
```

Currently reworking this script to use custom UI.
